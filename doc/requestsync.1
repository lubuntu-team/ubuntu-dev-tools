.TH REQUESTSYNC "1" "19 January 2008" "ubuntu-dev-tools"
.SH NAME
requestsync \- helper to file sync requests for Ubuntu
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B requestsync\fR [\fB\-ns\fR] [\fB\-k \fIkeyid\fR] <\fBsource package\fR> <\fBtarget release\fR> [\fIbase version\fR]

.B requestsync \-\-lp\fR [\fB\-ns\fR] <\fBsource package\fR> <\fBtarget release\fR> [\fIbase version\fR]

.B requestsync \-h
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
\fBrequestsync\fR looks at the versions of <source package> in Debian and
Ubuntu and prompts for an explanation of why the Ubuntu changes (if there
are any) should be dropped.
The changelog entry is then downloaded from packages.debian.org. If the sync
request is being filed per email (default), a prompt for your GPG passphrase
follows so that it can sign the mail and send it off to Launchpad.
Alternatively a sync request can be filed directly using the launchpadbugs
python module (option \fB\-\-lp\fR). \fBrequestsync\fR falls back to mail
the sync request if submitting using the launchpadbugs module fails.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Listed below are the command line options for requestsync:
.TP
.B \-h
Display a help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-n
Specifies that the package is a new package, and requestsync should not
attempt to look it up in Ubuntu since it will not exist.
.TP
.B \-s
Specifies that you require sponsorship.
You need this option if you are not a member of ubuntu-dev for universe or
multiverse, or ubuntu-core-dev for main or restricted.
.TP
.B \-k \fI<keyid>\fR
Specifies your GPG key.
Can also be set with the line `\fIexport GPGKEY=<keyid>\fR' in
.IR $HOME/.bashrc .
This is only used if the sync request is mailed to Launchpad.
.TP
.B \-\-lp
Use the launchpadbugs python module (packaged as python-launchpad-bugs) to
file the sync request in Launchpad.
.TP
.B <source package>
This is the source package that you would like to be synced from Debian.
.TP
.B <target release>
This is the release that you would like the source package to be synced
into.
This should always be the latest development release of Ubuntu.
.TP
.B [base version]
In some cases, the base version (where the Ubuntu package started differing
from the Debian package) cannot be automatically determined.
Specify this option in this case.
