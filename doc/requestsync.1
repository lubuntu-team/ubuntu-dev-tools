.SH NAME
requestsync \- helper to file sync requests for Ubuntu
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B requestsync\fR [\fB\-ns\fR] [\fB-k \fIkeyid\fR] <\fBsource package\fR> <\fBtarget release\fR> [\fIbase version\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP 
\fBrequestsync\fR looks at the versions of <source package> in Debian and
Ubuntu and prompts for an explanation of why the Ubuntu changes (if there
are any) should be dropped.
The changelog entry is then downloaded from packages.debian.org, followed by
a prompt for your GPG passphrase so that it can sign the mail and send it
off, to file a sync request in the form of a bug report in Launchpad.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Listed below are the command line options for requestsync:
.TP
.B \-n
Specifies that the package is a new package, and requestsync should not
attempt to look it up in Ubuntu since it will not exist.
.TP
.B \-s
Specifies that you require sponsorship.
You need this option if you are not a member of ubuntu-dev for universe or
multiverse, or ubuntu-core-dev for main or restricted.
.TP
.B \-k \fI<keyid>\fR
Specifies your GPC key.
Can also be set with the line `\fIexport GPGKEY=<keyid>\fR' in
.IR $HOME/.bashrc .
.TP
.B <source package>
This is the source package that you would like to be synced from Debian.
.TP
.B <target release>
This is the release that you would like the source package to be synced
into.
This should always be the latest development release of Ubuntu, i.e.: hardy.
.TP
.B [base version]
In some cases, the base version (where the Ubuntu package started differing
from the Debian package) cannot be automatically determined.
Specify this option in this case.
