\fBsetup-packaging-environment\fR \- helps one to get started with Ubuntu development

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsetup-packaging-environment\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsetup-packaging-environment\fR aims to make it more straightforward for new
contributors to get their Ubuntu installation ready for packaging work. It
ensures that all four components from Ubuntu's official repositories are enabled
along with their corresponding source repositories. It also installs a minimal
set of packages needed for Ubuntu packaging work (ubuntu-dev-tools, devscripts,
debhelper, patchutils, pbuilder, and build-essential). Finally, it assists
in defining the DEBEMAIL and DEBFULLNAME environment variables.
