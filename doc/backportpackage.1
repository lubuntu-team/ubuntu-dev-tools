.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-t \fIDEST\fR, \-\-to=\fIDEST\fR
\fBRequired\fR. Backport the package to the specified Ubuntu
release. This option may be specified multiple times, but must be
specified at least once.
.TP
.B \-f \fISOURCE\fR, \-\-from=\fISOURCE\fR
Backport the package from the specified Ubuntu release. If neither
this option nor \fB\-\-version\fR are specified, then
\fBbackportpackage\fR defaults to the current Ubuntu development
release.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-build
Build the package with the specified builder before uploading. Note
for \fBpbuilder\fR(8) users: This assumes the common configuration,
where the \fBDIST\fR environment is read by \fBpbuilderrc\fR(5) to
select the correct base image.
.TP
.B \-B \fIBUILDER\fR, \fB\-\-builder\fR=\fIBUILDER
Use the specified builder to build the package. Supported are
\fBpbuilder\fR(8) and \fBsbuild\fR(1). This overrides
\fBUBUNTUTOOLS_BUILDER\fR. The default is \fBpbuilder\fR(8).
.TP
.B \-U, \-\-update
Update the builder environment before attempting to build.
.TP
.B \-u \fIUPLOAD\fR, \-\-upload=\fIUPLOAD\fR
Upload to \fIUPLOAD\fR with \fBdput\fR(1) (after confirmation).
.TP
.B \-v \fIVERSION\fR, \-\-version=\fIVERSION\fR
If the \fB\-\-from\fR option is specified, then \fBbackportpackage\fR
verifies that the current version of \fIsource package\fR in
\fISOURCE\fR is the same as \fIVERSION\fR. Otherwise,
\fBbackportpackage\fR finds version \fIVERSION\fR of \fIsource
package\fR, regardless of the release in which it was published (or if
that version is still current).
.TP
.B \-l \fIINSTANCE\fR, \-\-launchpad=\fIINSTANCE\fR
Use the specified instance of Launchpad (e.g. "staging"), instead of
the default of "production".
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbackportpackage\fR fetches a package from one Ubuntu release and
creates a no-change backport of that package to a previous release,
optionally doing a test build of the package and/or uploading the
resulting backport for testing.
.PP
The backported package is fetched and built in a temporary directory
in \fB/tmp\fR, which is removed once the script finishes running.
.PP
\fBbackportpackage\fR is only recommended for testing backports in a
PPA, not uploading backports to the Ubuntu archive.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B UBUNTUTOOLS_BUILDER
The default builder for Ubuntu development tools that support it
(including \fBbackportpackage\fR. Supported are \fBpbuilder\fR(8) and
\fBsbuild\fR(1). If unset and not provided on the command line,
\fBpbuilder\fR(8) is used.
