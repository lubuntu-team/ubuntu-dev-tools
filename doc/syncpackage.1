.TH SYNCPACKAGE "1" "June 2010" "ubuntu-dev-tools"
.SH NAME
syncpackage \- helper to prepare .changes file to upload synced packages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B syncpackage
[\fIoptions\fR] \fI<.dsc URL/path or package name>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsyncpackage\fR generates a changes file to be directly uploaded to Ubuntu
primary archive or PPA starting from a pristine Debian package.
.PP
\fBsyncpackage\fR allows you to upload files with the same checksums of the
Debian ones, as the common script used by Ubuntu archive administrators does,
this way you can preserve source files integrity between the two distributions.
.PP
\fBsyncpackage\fR will detect source tarballs with mismatching checksums and will automatically create fake syncs instead.
.SH WARNING
The use of \fBsyncpackage\fR is discouraged by the Ubuntu Archive
Administrators, as it introduces an unnecessary window for error.
In future launchpad will offer the ability to directly perform sync
requests, without a developer having to do an upload.
Until then, it's advised to use \fBsyncpackage\fR with caution, and
request syncs via bugs with
.BR requestsync (1)
where possible.
