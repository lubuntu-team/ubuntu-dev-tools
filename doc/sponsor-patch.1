.TH sponsor\-patch "1" "September 21 2010" "ubuntu-dev-tools"
.SH NAME
sponsor\-patch \- Pull a patch / merge request from Launchpad,
test-build it, and upload.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sponsor\-patch \fR[\fIoptions\fR] \fIbug
.br
.B sponsor\-patch \-h

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsponsor\-patch\fR downloads the patch or Bazaar branch linked to
Ubuntu bug \fIbug\fR, applies it, generates a review diff, (optionally)
test builds it with
.BR pbuilder (8),
runs
.BR lintian (1)
and, after confirmation, can upload it.

\fBsponsor\-patch\fR can be used for sponsoring patches, merges from
Debian, SRUs, and creating debdiffs from patches.
If \fIbug\fR has multiple patches or branches linked, it will prompt the
user to select one.
The same applies to bug tasks.

.nr step 1 1
Some obvious checks are performed, in particular:
.IP \n[step]. 4
.BR update\-maintainer (1)
is run on the source package to ensure that the \fBMaintainer\fR field
meets the Ubuntu policy.
.IP \n+[step].
The version number must be greater than the current version in the
archive.
The \fBchanges\fR file is also correctly generated to list all changes
since the current version in the archive.
.IP \n+[step].
The changelog must automatically close the sponsorship bug.
.IP \n+[step].
The changelog target must be valid.
.IP \n+[step].
The changelog timestamp is touched.

.PP
Should any checks (or the build fail), the user has an option to edit
the patched source and try building it again.

The package will be built in the current directory (unless
.B SPONSOR_PATCH_WORKDIR
is set).
.BR pbuilder (8)
output will be placed in \fB./\fIsourcepkg\fB\-buildresult/\fR.
