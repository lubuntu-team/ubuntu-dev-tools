ubuntu-dev-tools (0.119) unstable; urgency=low

  launchpadlib 1.9 will cause some issues, as it uses the GNOME Keyring / KDE
  wallet to store credentials.
  https://help.launchpad.net/API/ThirdPartyIntegration

  Known issues and workarounds:

  Seeing keyring.backend.PasswordSetError or gnomekeyring.IOError when
  using ubuntu-dev-tools on a remote machine?
  Try ssh -X and run export `dbus-launch` in the ssh session.

  Otherwise, uninstalling python-gnomekeyring will force the credentials to be
  stored in ~/keyring_pass.cfg instead of a keyring, and bypass all these
  issues.
