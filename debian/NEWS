ubuntu-dev-tools (0.129) unstable; urgency=low

  Several tools that worked against Launchpad but were not specific to Ubuntu
  have been migrated to the "lptools" project.

  The following tools have moved:
   - get-branches (renamed to lp-get-branches)
   - grab-attachments (renamed to lp-grab-attachments)
   - lp-project-upload
   - lp-list-bugs
   - lp-set-dup
   - lp-shell

  They can now be found in the lptools package (version 0.0.1~bzr28-1 or
  later).

ubuntu-dev-tools (0.119) unstable; urgency=low

  launchpadlib 1.9 will cause some issues, as it uses the GNOME Keyring / KDE
  wallet to store credentials.
  https://help.launchpad.net/API/ThirdPartyIntegration

  Known issues and workarounds:

  Seeing keyring.backend.PasswordSetError or gnomekeyring.IOError when
  using ubuntu-dev-tools on a remote machine?
  Try ssh -X and run export `dbus-launch` in the ssh session.

  Otherwise, uninstalling python-gnomekeyring will force the credentials to be
  stored in ~/keyring_pass.cfg instead of a keyring, and bypass all these
  issues.
