    for armel.

  * Revert the submittodebian change to inline patches.  This is a style
    choice, the patch length has nothing to do with it; if there's demand for
    patch inlining, this should be made a (non-default) option to
    submittodebian.

  [ Emmet Hikory ]
  * mk-sbuild-lv: Add richer support for ports architectures in Ubuntu
  * mk-sbuild-lv: Really use -security for SOURCES_SECURITY_SUITE in Ubuntu

  [ Kumar Appaiah ]
  * submittodebian: if patch is relatively small (shorter than fifty
    lines), display it inline instead of attaching to the report.

  [ Michael Bienia ]
  * ubuntutools/requestsync/common.py: convert the changelog into a unicode
    string (lp: #498349)
  * ubuntutools/requestsync/mail.py: rmadison() returns now the most recent
    source line (Closes: #560758) 

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * pull-debian-source: Return the most recent source line. Depend on
    libapt-pkg-perl for the Debian version comparison required for this.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * submittodebian: os.system() doesn't throw exceptions, so attempt a
    'bzr diff' first and check the return value; otherwise we get no output
    at all from submittodebian in the non-bzr case.

  [ Manny Vindiola ]
  * grab-merge: Only download files listed multiple times in REPORT once

    unicode strings, use basestring to catch bot str and unicode.
  * Depend on python-lazr.restfulclient, package was recently renamed
    from python-lazr-restfulclient to match Python naming schema.

  [ Jonathan Davies ]

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * lpapicache: Do not immediately bail out if we have no credentials to
    login. Clients are now expected to handle the lack of credentials
    themselves.
  * pull-lp-source: Make LP API use optional - fall back to a hardcoded
    default release if we aren't using it. (LP: #477670)
  * pull-lp-source: Detect more failure conditions and give a nice error
    instead of a trace
  * buildd, requestsync, grab-attachments, hugdaylist, update-maintainer: 
    Detect & bail if we don't have credentials and need them. These scripts
    cannot continue under those circumstances.

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * mk-sbuild-lv: switch to ext4 by default.

  [ Siegfried-Angel Gevatter Pujals ]

  * debian/control: Re-add XS-Python-Version - this is more standard
  * debian/pyversions: Drop
  * pbuilder-dist: Don't pass --logfile if we are trying to log in to the
    chroot - the logfile option swallows the prompt, and we probably don't
    want to log if we are using login anyway.

  [ Nathan Handler ]
  * debian/control: Mention lp-project-upload in Description

  [ Siegfried-Angel Gevatter Pujals ]
  * debian/control:
     - Improve description of pbuilder-dist and mention cowbuilder-dist.
  * pbuilder-dist:
     - Abort if the host's architecture can't be determined.
     - Error out instead of showing a traceback if pbuilder-dist is called
       without any argument.
  * pbuilder-dist, ubuntutools/misc.py:
     - Move the functions used to determine the hosts architecture and
       distribution to the ubuntutools.misc module.

     - Add a new script, setup-packaging-environment.

  * update-maintainer: Also check if package is in experimental when looking
    who to update maintainer to. 
  * update-maintainer: Prefer updating control.in to control; this is used by
    some Debian packages, notably those maintained by pkg-gnome.
  * debian/control: Update standards-version to 3.8.3, no changes
  * debian/control, debian/pyversions: Remove XS-Python version to
    debian/pyversions to silence a warning

  [ Nathan Handler ]
  * debian/control: Mention pull-revu-source in description

  * Drop python-launchpad-bugs from Depends.
  * Add python-lazr-restfulclient to Depends.
  * buildd: Add a --batch mode for batch retrying/rescoring of packages.
  * requestsync:
    - Use UBU* environment variables before the DEB* ones (lp: #400133)
    - Split requestsync into a "mail" module and a "lpapi" module and use
      the LP API only when --lp was used. In "mail" mode requestsync has
      to ask some more questions for parts it can't find out without LP API.
      (lp: #406659, #416955)

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * requestsync:
    - Guard some calls when -n is specified
    - Fetch changelog of specified version, not current version. If an
      experimenal upload happened after the unstable one we're syncing, this
      is considered to be current by p.d.o and we would get those changelog
      entries in the sync request
    - Remove trailing fullstop from sync bug title
  * suspicious-source: Add *.hs *.el *.css to whitelist

  [ Siegfried-Angel Gevatter Pujals ]

       and Ryan Pavlik (LP: #363043).

      also remove unneeded XB-Python-Version field from binary stanza.
    - debian/rules: set DEB_PYTHON_SYSTEM to pysupport.
    - ubuntu-dev-tools.preinst: remove stale pycentral files on upgrades.

       debian_changelog.
     - Fix --lp for Firefox 3 (LP: #208808):
       It now tries ~/.lpcookie.txt, ~/.mozilla/*/*/cookies.sqlite and
       ~/.mozilla/*/*/cookies.txt to find a Launchpad cookie file.
       Also added a hint that you can create a valid file, by logging into
       Launchpad with Firefox.
     - Added confirm loops, which displays the message to be send/posted and
       either allows to edit (or forces to, in case of Ubuntu changes).

       This adds a convient edit_report method, which gets used both from the
       Launchpad and mail code path.
     - Do not fallback to submitting by email, if posting to Launchpad failed.
       This hasn't been requested and therefore should not get done.

     - mail_bug: Catch socket.error (LP: #190739)

       want to know the architecture if a symlink was being used. Thanks to

     - Escape many variables to avoid possible problems there.
     - Reorganize the code a bit and comment it.

  * mk-sbuild-lv: check for debootstrap release names in
    /usr/share/debootstreap/releases and not in /usr/lib/debootstrap/releases

      SYSCACHE = 0 use the default from pbuilderrc or honor $DEBCACHE
      (LP: #156183)
    - removed $BINARCH check in pbuilder call, and set --debootstrapopts
      directly, it doesn't matter when it's always set.  The Subshell call

    - added support for --http-proxy, honours now $http_proxy or $HTTP_PROXY
