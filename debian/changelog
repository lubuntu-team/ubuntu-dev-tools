     - Fix --lp for Firefox 3 (LP: #208808):
       It now tries ~/.lpcookie.txt, ~/.mozilla/*/*/cookies.sqlite and
       ~/.mozilla/*/*/cookies.txt to find a Launchpad cookie file.
       Also added a hint that you can create a valid file, by logging into
       Launchpad with Firefox.
     - Added confirm loops, which displays the message to be send/posted and
       either allows to edit (or forces to, in case of Ubuntu changes).
       (LP: #194613, #194615)
       This adds a convient edit_report method, which gets used both from the
       Launchpad and mail code path.
     - Do not fallback to submitting by email, if posting to Launchpad failed.
       This hasn't been requested and therefore should not get done.
     - post_bug: Catch IOError when setting bug importance (LP: #190061)
     - mail_bug: Catch socket.error (LP: #190739)

  * mk-sbuild-lv: check for debootstrap release names in
    /usr/share/debootstreap/releases and not in /usr/lib/debootstrap/releases
  * pbuilder-dist:

      SYSCACHE = 0 use the default from pbuilderrc or honor $DEBCACHE
      (LP: #156183)
    - removed $BINARCH check in pbuilder call, and set --debootstrapopts

    - added support for --http-proxy, honours now $http_proxy or $HTTP_PROXY

      and add --aptconfdir to pbuilder call (LP: #175183)
    - add support for gksudo|kdesudo|sudo depending on $DESKTOP_SESSION.
