  [ Siegfried-Angel Gevatter Pujals (RainCT) ]
  * pbuilder-dist.new:
     - Rewrite the script in Python to make it more robust and faster.
  * what-patch:
     - If cdbs-edit-patch is used, output "cdbs (patchsys.mk)" instead of
       just "cdbs" (LP: #195795).
  * check-symbols:
     - Add a brief explanation about why sudo privilegies are required
       in order to run this script (LP: #194622).
     - End with exit code 1 if there's an error.

     - Whitelist C# files (LP: #225691): *.cs.

  [ Daniel Hahler ]
  * requestsync:
     - Use debian_bundle.changelog.Version for version comparison in
       debian_changelog.
     - Fix --lp for Firefox 3 (LP: #208808):
       It now tries ~/.lpcookie.txt, ~/.mozilla/*/*/cookies.sqlite and
       ~/.mozilla/*/*/cookies.txt to find a Launchpad cookie file.
       Also added a hint that you can create a valid file, by logging into
       Launchpad with Firefox.
     - Added confirm loops, which displays the message to be send/posted and
       either allows to edit (or forces to, in case of Ubuntu changes).
       (LP: #194613, #194615)
       This adds a convient edit_report method, which gets used both from the
       Launchpad and mail code path.
     - Do not fallback to submitting by email, if posting to Launchpad failed.
       This hasn't been requested and therefore should not get done.
     - post_bug: Catch IOError when setting bug importance (LP: #190061)
     - mail_bug: Catch socket.error (LP: #190739)

  [ Kees Cook ]

    - added details for each patch system report.
  * pull-debian-debdiff:
    - parse .dsc file for required source files.
    - switch to GPLv3
  * debian/control: add Depends needed for pull-debian-debdiff.
  * debian/copyright:
    - updated pull-debian-debdiff, which is now GPLv3.
    - adjusted Copyright lines to make lintian happy.

  [ Andrew Hunter ]

      robust and less code duplication.

  [ Daniel Holbach ]

       was being used .
     - Fix a recently introduced problem where pbuilder-dist would always
       want to know the architecture if a symlink was being used. Thanks to
       Adrien Cunin and James Westby for their help on this (LP: #194633).
     - Escape many variables to avoid possible problems there.
     - Reorganize the code a bit and comment it.
     - Accept "upgrade" as an alias for "update".
     - Hide lsb_release's traceback if pbuilder-dist is manually aborted

  [ Daniel Hahler ]

      When interaction is not required, ask the user if she wants to edit.
      (LP: #190351)

  [ Siegfried-Angel Gevatter Pujals (RainCT) ]

  [ Stephan Hermann ]
  * mk-sbuild-lv: check for debootstrap release names in
    /usr/share/debootstreap/releases and not in /usr/lib/debootstrap/releases
  * pbuilder-dist:
    - check if $SYSCACHE is not set and stay with the default, if
      SYSCACHE = 0 use the default from pbuilderrc or honor $DEBCACHE
      (LP: #156183)
    - removed $BINARCH check in pbuilder call, and set --debootstrapopts
      directly, it doesn't matter when it's always set.  The Subshell call
      didn't work  (LP: #175183)
    - added support for --http-proxy, honours now $http_proxy or $HTTP_PROXY
    - removed $COMPONENTS_LINE from pbuilder call, data is crippled in the
      pbuilder chroot.
      Instead of this behaviour add $BASE_DIR/etc/$DISTRIBUTION/apt.conf/

      and add --aptconfdir to pbuilder call (LP: #175183)
    - add support for gksudo|kdesudo|sudo depending on $DESKTOP_SESSION.

  * what-patch: change default operation back to quiet mode -- script is used
    in automated tools, so default behavior is best to leave unchanged.
  * check-symbols: check for binary list very carefully.
  * dch-repeat: add Hardy to distro list.
  * mk-sbuild-lv: use -r instead of -f for possible debootstrap symlinks.
