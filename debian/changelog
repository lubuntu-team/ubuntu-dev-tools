  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add suspicious-source: Output a list of files which are not common source
    files. This should be run in the root of a source tree to find files which
    might not be the 'prefered form of modification' that the GPL and other
    licenses require.

  [ Luke Yelavich ]
  * Removed ubuntu-cd and ubuntu-sync. They are currently undergoing
    major reworking, and will be re-included when ready.
